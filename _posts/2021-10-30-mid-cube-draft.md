It's been another long while since we got together for a cube draft. On the eve of Halloween, we drafted the cube with Innistrad: Midnight Hunt cards! This time around we only had time for a single draft, despite trying to get 2 draft in. We had the typical lunch of Domino's Pizza as everyone played through the games. Four players showed up: Mikey, Gerf, Jeddy, and Brian. 

Who will come out a victor on this spooky draft pod?!

Innistrad: Midnight Hunt added a surprising amount of cards to the draft. Some of them showed up in decks and some were left as draft fodder in the sideboards.

The draft order:
Mikey -> Jeddy -> Gerf -> Brian

Jeddy won the draft with his Simic Midrange deck. It's recorded as a Dimir midrange deck because that's what he sided into to beat gerf's Mono-red aggro deck (as per his request). I drafted a mostly-white aggro deck (Jeskai Aggro) and Brian had a Golgari aggro.

|       | Mikey | Gerf  | Jeddy | Brian |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Mikey |       |  1-2  |  1-2  |  2-0  |
| Gerf  |  2-1  |       |  1-2  |  2-1  |
| Jeddy |  2-1  |  2-1  |       |  1-2  |
| Brian |  0-2  |  1-2  |  2-1  |       |

## Jeddy's Deck (1st) - [Dimir Midrange](https://cubecobra.com/cube/deck/617d9d57254836102d12fd29)

As mentioned earlier, Jeddy's original deck was a Simic midrange deck, but because he faced Gerf's Mono-red aggro deck in the finals, he needed to switch to something that would give him a fighting chance. As is, I don't really have much to say about this deck since I didn't personally face it. 

On the surface, it seems that Jeddy's deck is a bit of a blue-black good stuff deck that happened to pair well against Gerf's aggro deck in Game 3. With 3 Wraths and multiple ways to deal with the board with 2-for-1s (Sower of Temptation, Hostage Taker), it would've been hostile to any creature based aggro deck.

## Gerf's Deck (2nd) - [Mono-Red Aggro](https://cubecobra.com/cube/deck/617d9c06254836102d12f897)

![Mono-Red Aggro](/images/decks/211030_Gerf_Mono-Red.jpg "Mono-Red Aggro")

This gets my vote for the best deck of the draft as its a pretty streamlined mono-red aggro deck. This is the first example of having a mono-colored deck in a draft we've gotten. I personally think mono-colored decks are easier to come by when you have a full pod, but if drafters are solidified in certain colors, it's possible to happen in smaller pods.

From what I heard, even if Jeddy managed to switch into his Dimir midrange/control deck, he got a bit lucky that Gerf's Goblin Guide in game 3 gave him 3 lands to help him ensure his land drops. Without that help, we might be seeing a different deck finishing first this time around. 

Plenty of burn and only 2 cards with mana value above 3, this is a scary sight to behold. My only issue is that Gerf should've drafted 2 wastelands instead of the Grate Furnace and Den of the Bugbear for his aggro deck to hold down midrange and control decks alike. A couple more 1mv creatures would've gone a long way too in place of some of the 3-drops he has in the deck.

## Mikey's Deck (3rd) - [Jeskai Aggro](https://cubecobra.com/cube/deck/617d9a72254836102d12f529)

<img src="/images/mtg/mh1-214-soulherder.jpg" alt="Soulherder" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/ogw-157-reflector-mage.jpg" alt="Reflector Mage" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/afr-398-portable-hole.jpg" alt="Portable Hole" width="200"/>

![Jeskai Aggro](/images/decks/211030_Mikey_Jeskai_Aggro.jpg "Jeskai Aggro")

My deck was mostly a white aggro deck that had the mana to splash both red and blue. Red mainly to complete my aggressive creature suite and blue was my plan in case games went longer than I expected. Reflector Mage was great as 2-for-1 removal for larger creatures (Swords to Plowshares and Path to Exile too), as I had plenty of removal for the cheaper early game threats (Portable Hole, Prismatic Ending).

Finishing 3rd is a hard pill to swallow because I thought my deck was pretty good and had answers for all the other decks in the field.

## Brian's Deck (4th) - [Golgari Aggro](https://cubecobra.com/cube/deck/617d9838254836102d12f2cd)

![Golgari Aggro](/images/decks/211030_Brian_Golgari.jpg "Golgari Aggro")

Brian's drafting and deck building is getting better and better each time we play. This time a Golgari Aggro deck. He was wise to keep his casting costs low and Living Death was a nice surprise once his initial onslaught was quelled. I think improving this deck would be to focus it a bit more on attacking by removing Meren of Clan Nel Toth, Sylvan Library, Satyr Wayfinder and even Living Death to apply more pressure early. Rely on the fact that many of your creatures already return from the graveyard. Or you can take it the other direction where you focus on the midrange capabilities and have a bit of a sacrifice theme and run Meren with Living Death and all your creatures are 3-4 mana value.
