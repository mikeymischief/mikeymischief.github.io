It's been a long time since I've updated this blog. The main reason being that while I still update my cube and hope to get a draft some day, the playgroup has moved onto playing commander. So in attempt to capture what we're playing, I'll be updating the blog with our commander games.

<!--more-->

We played 5 games of commander at 4 players: Me, Gerf, Brian, and Jubee.

Then after Jubee left we played 2 more games at 3 players (not recorded).

Overall, the wins were pretty evened out amongst everyone with Jubee winning twice with [Rivaz of the Claw](https://scryfall.com/card/dmu/215/rivaz-of-the-claw) and [Minsc and Boo, Timeless Heroes](https://scryfall.com/card/clb/285/minsc-&-boo-timeless-heroes), Gerf winning once with [Captain N'ghathrod](https://scryfall.com/card/clb/646/captain-nghathrod), Brian winning with [The Mimeoplasm](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/254/the-mimeoplasm) and my win with [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](https://scryfall.com/card/puma/U13/tasigur-the-golden-fang).

| Player | Commander      | Wins |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| Brian | The Mimeoplasm | 1 |
| Gerf | Captain N'ghathrod  | 1 |
| Jubee | Minsc & Boo, Timeless Heroes | 1 |
|  | Rivaz of the Claw | 1 |
| Mike | Tasigur, the Golden Fang | 1 |

# Game 1

<img src="/images/mtg/clb-266-baba-lysaga-night-witch.jpg" alt="Baba Lysaga, Night Witch" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/dmu-215-rivaz-of-the-claw.jpg" alt="Rivaz of the Claw" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/ncc-1-anhelo-the-painter.jpg" alt="Anhelo, the Painter" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/brc-39-mishra-eminent-one.jpg" alt="Mishra, Eminent One" width="180"/>

Gerf played [Karn's Temporal Sundering](https://scryfall.com/card/dom/55/karns-temporal-sundering) which was copied with [Anhelo, the Painter](https://scryfall.com/card/ncc/1/anhelo-the-painter) and again with [Twinning Staff](https://scryfall.com/card/ncc/383/twinning-staff). With those 3 extra turns, Gerf attacks and kills both Brian and myself, leaving just Jubee in the game.  

Jubee recast [Terror of the Peaks](https://scryfall.com/card/m21/164/terror-of-the-peaks), then cast [Rivaz of the Claw](https://scryfall.com/card/dmu/215/rivaz-of-the-claw) to trigger [Terror of the Peaks](https://scryfall.com/card/m21/164/terror-of-the-peaks), killing Gerf

Winner: Rivaz of the Claw

# Game 2

<img src="/images/mtg/afc-324-prosper-tome-bound.jpg" alt="Prosper, Tome-Bound" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/2x2-211-ezuri-claw-of-progress.jpg" alt="Ezuri, Claw of Progress" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/clb-646-captain-n-ghathrod.jpg" alt="Captain N'ghathrod" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/2x2-169-aminatou-the-fateshifter.jpg" alt="Aminatou, the Fateshifter" width="180"/>

During the midgame, Brian's [Night Incarnate](https://scryfall.com/card/c18/17/night-incarnate) was blinked with [Teleporation Circle](https://scryfall.com/card/afr/39/teleportation-circle), [Aminatou, the Fatestitcher](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/169/aminatou-the-fateshifter) or [Kaya, Ghost Assassin](https://scryfall.com/card/cn2/75/kaya-ghost-assassin), which kept all the small creatures off the board, so Jubee and I couldn't build our boards back, essentially leaving only Gerf's creatures, a [Hullbreak Horror](https://scryfall.com/card/clb/724/hullbreaker-horror), on the battlefield. Eventually, Gerf attacks for the win.

Winner: Captain N'ghathrod

# Game 3

<img src="/images/mtg/puma-U13-tasigur-the-golden-fang.jpg" alt="Tasigur, the Golden Fang" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/mh2-69-svyelun-of-sea-and-sky.jpg" alt="Svyelun of Sea and Sky" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/c21-6-willowdusk-essence-seer.jpg" alt="Willowdusk, Essence Seer" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/c13-203-oloro-ageless-ascetic.jpg" alt="Oloro, Ageless Ascetic" width="180"/>

Turn 3, I drop a [Rhystic Study](https://scryfall.com/card/pcy/45/rhystic-study), drawing multiple cards and making each of my land drops. Brian's [Oloro, Ageless Ascetic](https://scryfall.com/card/c13/203/oloro-ageless-ascetic) keeps gaining him so much life with [Serra Ascendant](https://scryfall.com/card/ima/31/serra-ascendant) and doubling it with [Rhox Faithmender](https://scryfall.com/card/jmp/130/rhox-faithmender). He gets up to 91 life and quickly becomes the archenemy. Jubee empties his hand of creatures and gets extremely salty when I tutor up and cast (the following turn) a [The Meathook Massacre](https://scryfall.com/card/mid/348/the-meathook-massacre). My thinking was that we were not going to outpace his life gain by attacking and we needed to get all his creatures off the battlefield. Despite that, I had a plan to drop [Toxrill, the Corrosive](https://scryfall.com/card/vow/132/toxrill-the-corrosive) the following turn and control the game into a win from there.  

Gerf kills my [Toxrill](https://scryfall.com/card/vow/132/toxrill-the-corrosive) immediately, which puts me on the combo path. So I eventually cast [Intuition](https://scryfall.com/card/tmp/70/intuition), targeting Brian, to choose between:

<img src="/images/mtg/isd-78-snapcaster-mage.jpg" alt="Snapcaster Mage" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/nph-118-noxious-revival.jpg" alt="Noxious Revival" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/atq-14-transmute-artifact.jpg" alt="Transmute Artifact" width="200"/>

They choose to give me [Snapcaster Mage](https://scryfall.com/card/isd/78/snapcaster-mage), which I immediately flashback [Transmute Artifact](https://scryfall.com/card/atq/14/transmute-artifact), transmuting my [Dimir Signet](https://scryfall.com/card/sld/287/dimir-signet) into [Bolas Citadel](https://scryfall.com/card/war/79/bolass-citadel), after paying 4 mana. I already had [Aetherflux Reservoir](https://scryfall.com/card/brr/2/aetherflux-reservoir) out so I just needed [Sensei's Divining Top](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/398/senseis-divining-top), which I fetched with [Demonic Tutor](https://scryfall.com/card/leb/105/demonic-tutor).

I drew my deck out, gained over 100k life and shot everyone with [Aetherflux Reservoir](https://scryfall.com/card/brr/2/aetherflux-reservoir).

Winner: Tasigur, the Golden Fang

# Game 4

<img src="/images/mtg/c17-46-taigam-ojutai-master.jpg" alt="Taigam, Ojutai Master" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/clb-285-minsc-boo-timeless-heroes.jpg" alt="Minsc & Boo, Timeless Heroes" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/ncc-2-henzie-toolbox-torre.jpg" alt="Henzie Toolbox Torre" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/2x2-254-the-mimeoplasm.jpg" alt="The Mimeoplasm" width="180"/>

This game saw an unimpeded 20/20 [Mimeoplasm](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/254/the-mimeoplasm) just trample over everyone, killing everyone by commander damage. Brian casted an early game [Buried Alive](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/88/buried-alive) to set up [The Mimeoplasm](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/254/the-mimeoplasm). I tried to delay for anyone to have an answer, with [Said/Done](https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/60/said-done), by tapping it for 2 turns (since I get _rebound_ through [Taigam](https://scryfall.com/card/c17/46/taigam-ojutai-master)), but no one had removal. Brian's commander was paired with [Rhonas, the Indomitable](https://scryfall.com/card/akh/182/rhonas-the-indomitable) to kill Jubee with commander damage even through blocks. Then Brian quickly turned his focus towards both Gerf and I and we couldn't stop the monstrosity either.

Winner: The Mimeoplasm

# Game 5

<img src="/images/mtg/afc-324-prosper-tome-bound.jpg" alt="Prosper, Tome-Bound" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/clb-285-minsc-boo-timeless-heroes.jpg" alt="Minsc & Boo, Timeless Heroes" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/2xm-190-atraxa-praetors-voice.jpg" alt="Atraxa, Praetors Voice" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/uma-199-gaddock-teeg.jpg" alt="Gaddock Teeg" width="180"/>

This was another close game I could've won, if I only had one more treasure.  

In the early game, Brian, playing his hatebear deck, was restricting everyone from doing pretty much anything with [Gaddock Teeg](https://scryfall.com/card/uma/199/gaddock-teeg), [Null Rod](https://scryfall.com/card/wth/154/null-rod), and [Containment Priest](https://scryfall.com/card/m21/13/containment-priest), holding everyone back. He immediately became the archenemy. Also despite [Null Rod](https://scryfall.com/card/wth/154/null-rod) being on the battlefield, both Jubee and Gerf were still cracking their treasure tokens created from [Old Gnawbone](https://scryfall.com/card/afr/197/old-gnawbone) and [Smothering Tithe](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/342/smothering-tithe) respectively.  

Late game, I manage to create 9 treasure tokens, and sacrifice thm to [Grim Hireling](https://scryfall.com/card/clb/755/grim-hireling), which dealt 32 damage to Brian (his life total) since [Marionette Master](https://scryfall.com/card/afc/102/marionette-master)'s power was 4 from a _proliferate_ from Gerf's [Sword of Truth and Justice](https://scryfall.com/card/mh1/229/sword-of-truth-and-justice) stolen by [Grenzo, Havoc Raiser](https://scryfall.com/card/cn2/54/grenzo-havoc-raiser).  

The Jubee kills Gerf, at 10 life, with his creatures, leaving us 1v1. Jubee creates 4 copies of his dragons to stifle any attack by my smaller creatures.

I have 3 treasure tokens, [Marionette Master](https://scryfall.com/card/afc/102/marionette-master) at 4-power, and Jubee at 15 life. I go in the tank and can't come up with any other way to create another treasure. I missed the play where attacking with my [Magda](https://scryfall.com/card/khm/142/magda-brazen-outlaw) would've created that treasure and I could crack all 4 treasures, dealing 16 to Jubee.

Winner: Misc & Boo, Timeless Heroes
