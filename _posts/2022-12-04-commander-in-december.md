It's been a long time since I've updated this blog. The main reason being that while I still update my cube and hope to get a draft some day, the playgroup has moved onto playing commander. So in attempt to capture what we're playing, I'll be updating the blog with our commander games.

<!--more-->

We played 5 games of commander at 4 players: Me, Gerf, Brian, and Jubee.

Then after Jubee left we played 2 more games at 3 players.

Overall, the wins were pretty evened out amongst everyone with Jubee winning twice Rivaz of the Claw and Minsc and Boo, Timeless Heroes, Gerf winning once with Captain N'ghathrod, Brian winning with The Mimeoplasm and my win with Tasigur, the Golden Fang.

| Player | Commander      | Wins |
| ----- | ------- | ----- |
| Brian | The Mimeoplasm | 1 |
| Gerf | Captain N'ghathrod  | 1 |
| Jubee | Minsc & Boo, Timeless Heroes | 1 |
|  | Rivaz of the Claw | 1 |
| Mike | Tasigur, the Golden Fang | 1 |
