It's been a long time since I've updated this blog. The main reason being that while I still update my cube and hope to get a draft some day, the playgroup has moved onto playing commander. So in attempt to capture what we're playing, I'll be updating the blog with our commander games.

<!--more-->

We played 5 games of commander at 4 players: Me, Gerf, Brian, and Jubee.

Then after Jubee left we played 4 more games at 3 players.

Overall, the wins were pretty evened out amongst everyone.

## Game 1 - Baba Lysaga / (Rivaz of the Claw) / Anhelo, the Painter / Mishra, Eminent One

Anhelo kill

Karn's Temporal Sundering (copied with Anhelo, the Painter and again with Twinning Staff), Attacks Brian and Me to kill, leaving Jubee
Jubee Cast Terror of the Peaks, then cast Rivaz of the Claw to trigget Terror and finish Gerf

## Game 2 - Prosper, Tome-Bound / Elzuri of the Claw / (Captain N'ghathrod) / Aminatou, the Fatestitcher

Night Incarnate blinked with Teleporation Circle, Aminatou, the Fatestitcher or Kaya, Ghost Assassin, kept all the small creatures off the board, leaving only Gerf's Hullbreak Horror +1 creature on the battlefield. Gerf attacks for the win
