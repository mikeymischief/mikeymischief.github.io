We played commander during a rare storm in LA! The same 4 players joined for this outing: Me, Gerf, Brian, and Jubee. We got to play a full day this time, playing 4 full games of commander, then a Warhammer 40k precon showdown and finally, a 3-player game since Jubee left early.

Who won each game? Click on to find out!

The games started at 9:30am since Brian came late, but luckily since the first few games were relatively quick because of [Mishra, Claimed by Gix](https://scryfall.com/card/bro/216/mishra-claimed-by-gix)'s aggro strategy, [Jetmir, Nexus of Revels](https://scryfall.com/card/snc/193/jetmir-nexus-of-revels) token aggro strategy, and [Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy](https://scryfall.com/card/iko/192/kinnan-bonder-prodigy)'s explosive mana. I feel if there was more interaction played at the table, then those single-minded glass cannon decks would be easily hated out. Since that wasn't the case, those decks got off to a great start but required the whole table to focus their efforts to slow it down.

Overall, Gerf had a win with [Nalia de'Arnise](https://scryfall.com/card/clb/649/nalia-dearnise), Jubee with a win on [Mangara, the Diplomat](https://scryfall.com/card/m21/27/mangara-the-diplomat), and I won twice, the first one with [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](https://scryfall.com/card/puma/U13/tasigur-the-golden-fang) and [Baba Lysaga, Night Witch](https://scryfall.com/card/clb/525/baba-lysaga-night-witch).

The 40k deck showdown was won by the monoblack "Necron Dynasties" deck piloted by Gerf. Those decks were fun, but I feel since they weren't built or modified by the pilots, they only felt mediocre.

We had lunch delivered by Noodle Street, which was a delicious mix of soups (on this cold, rainy day) and Kimchi Fried Rice.

Anyway, onto the details!

# Game 1

<img src="/images/mtg/mid-232-liesa-forgotten-archangel.jpg" alt="Liesa, Forgotten Archangel" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/clb-647-faldorn-dread-wolf-herald.jpg" alt="Faldorn, Dread Wolf Herald" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/afc-324-prosper-tome-bound.jpg" alt="Prosper, Tome-Bound" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/bro-216-mishra-claimed-by-gix.jpg" alt="Mishra, Claimed by Gix" width="180"/>

Jubee got off to a great aggressive start with Mishra, and since he drains for the amount of his attackers, he didn't _really_ need to have much defense. Combined with the fact that he built the deck to be multiple combat steps with [Combat Celebrant](https://scryfall.com/search?q=c%3Dr+o%3Aexert+o%3Acombat) and [Port Razer](https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/193/port-razer), he was draining over 10 life a turn (including a [Szat's Will](https://scryfall.com/card/cmr/152/szats-will) for 3 0/1 Thrull tokens). 

Despite all that, Brian was eliminated early and Gerf attacked both Jubee and I, leaving us both at 1 life. On his alpha strike, I cracked a Treasure token to [Professional Face-Breaker](https://scryfall.com/card/snc/426/professional-face-breaker) to play the top of my library, which I knew was a [Price of Progress](https://scryfall.com/card/exo/95/price-of-progress) to kill everyone; so we drew.

# Game 2

<img src="/images/mtg/snc-193-jetmir-nexus-of-revels.jpg" alt="Jetmir, Nexus of Revels" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/clb-649-nalia-de-arnise.jpg" alt="Nalia de'Arnise" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/mic-2-wilhelt-the-rotcleaver.jpg" alt="Wilhelt, the Rotcleaver" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/bro-216-mishra-claimed-by-gix.jpg" alt="Mishra, Claimed by Gix" width="180"/>

The Second game got off to another fast start because [Jetmir, Nexus of Revels](https://scryfall.com/card/snc/193/jetmir-nexus-of-revels) got off to a explosive start with [Parallel Lives](https://scryfall.com/card/isd/199/parallel-lives), [Jinnie Fay](https://scryfall.com/card/snc/195/jinnie-fay-jetmirs-second) creating 3/1 Dog tokens and a [Chitterspitter](https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/153/chitterspitter) starting the token train. Jubee was also a bit mana short, so he wasn't really in this game.

I was the only one to slow him down with a [Necroduality](https://scryfall.com/card/vow/70/necroduality) and [Noxious Ghoul](https://scryfall.com/card/lgn/77/noxious-ghoul) to give all his creatures -2/-2. Now my Wilhelt deck would've won this game too, but Gerf got an early [Maskwood Nexus](https://scryfall.com/card/clb/865/maskwood-nexus) so all his creatures were considered "zombies" as well. So all my one-sided board wipes didn't affect him, and he won by growing his army of not-actually-zombies every combat step, which included 2 fliers that ultimately killed me, once Brian was taken care of.

Winner: Nalia de'Arnise

# Game 3

<img src="/images/mtg/neo-123-tatsunari-toad-rider.jpg" alt="Tatsunari, Toad Rider" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/clb-72-gale-waterdeep-prodigy.jpg" alt="Gale, Waterdeep Prodigy" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/iko-192-kinnan-bonder-prodigy.jpg" alt="Kinnan, Bonder Prodigy" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/m21-27-mangara-the-diplomat.jpg" alt="Mangara, the Diplomat" width="180"/>

This game was the first long-ish game, with Jubee playing the mono-white Mangara deck, which he kept a one-lander, but had [Weathered Wayfarer](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/34/weathered-wayfarer), then slowly drawing cards from double-spelling opponents.

No one really paid attention to him because we're good sports about not attacking a person that is not having a great start. So we beat up on each other and when our life totals were low, Jubee casted a [Call the Coppercoats](https://scryfall.com/card/ncc/195/call-the-coppercoats) for 17 soldiers. Then when it reached my turn, I casted [Whispering Madness](https://scryfall.com/card/c16/229/whispering-madness) onto my [Astral Dragon](https://scryfall.com/card/clb/664/astral-dragon) - awesome card, I got to copy both [Leyline of Anticipation](https://scryfall.com/card/clb/726/leyline-of-anticipation) and [Rhystic Study](https://scryfall.com/card/pcy/45/rhystic-study), and made everyone wheel 26 cards. Unbeknownst to me, it provided Jubee with [Divine Sacrament](https://scryfall.com/card/ody/19/divine-sacrament) and [Dictate of Heliod](https://scryfall.com/card/c15/68/dictate-of-heliod) so his tokens were 4-power and killed everyone "out of nowhere".

Winner: Mangara, the Diplomat

# Game 4

<img src="/images/mtg/m21-27-mangara-the-diplomat.jpg" alt="Mangara, the Diplomat" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/clb-646-captain-n-ghathrod.jpg" alt="Captain N'ghathrod" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/puma-U13-tasigur-the-golden-fang.jpg" alt="Tasigur, the Golden Fang" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/c19-37-anje-falkenrath.jpg" alt="Anje Falkenrath" width="180"/>

This game was a wild one!

I drew [Rhystic Study](https://scryfall.com/card/pcy/45/rhystic-study) on Turn 3, so I played it that same turn. It was removed one round later, but then on turn 4, I played my [Wishclaw Talisman](https://scryfall.com/card/eld/357/wishclaw-talisman) and immediately searched for [Neoform](https://scryfall.com/card/war/206/neoform), then casted it targeting Tasigur and transforming it into [Toxrill, the Corrosive](https://scryfall.com/card/vow/132/toxrill-the-corrosive). The reason I choose that creature, was because I saw several of the Anje Falkenrath deck with 3 2/2 creatures, the Mangara deck with 3 1/1s, and [Captain N'ghathrod](https://scryfall.com/card/clb/646/captain-nghathrod) with several 2-toughness and 3-toughness creatures. 

By my next turn (turn 5), I had over 9 slugs in play, but since Jubee had a [Linvala, Keeper of Silence](https://scryfall.com/card/jmp/119/linvala-keeper-of-silence), I couldn't activate Toxrill's active ability to draw cards. While I still had control, Gerf evetually removed Toxrill and managed to get [Body Double](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/40/body-double) to copy it before I removed it with [Assassin's Trophy](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/372/assassins-trophy). 

My next couple turns, I had to grind for a win, by using [Seedborn Muse](https://scryfall.com/card/lgn/138/seedborn-muse) and activating [Tasigur, the Golden Fang](https://scryfall.com/card/puma/U13/tasigur-the-golden-fang)'s activated ability to draw cards. What kept me alive was [Propaganda](https://scryfall.com/card/tmp/80/propaganda) as everyone else kept developing their board instead of paying the 2 mana to attack me. I didn't get anything important, as they were choosing the worst cards, but I was getting card advantage. At one point, they gave me the [Narset, Parter of Veils](https://scryfall.com/card/war/61/narset-parter-of-veils) into a previously telegraphed [Windfall](https://scryfall.com/card/usg/111/windfall), but on the next turn that I was going to play it, I just realized I could win the game since I drew a [Demonic Tutor](https://scryfall.com/card/leb/105/demonic-tutor). I searched for [Yawgmoth's Will](https://scryfall.com/card/usg/171/yawgmoths-will) since [Bolas' Citadel](https://scryfall.com/card/war/79/bolass-citadel) was already milled into my graveyard. I played [Sensei's Divining Top](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/398/senseis-divining-top) earlier, but it was destroyed by Brian and eventually returned to my hand through Tasigur. I now had my combo, so I drew the rest of my deck and killed everyone else with the [Aetherflux Reservior](https://scryfall.com/card/brr/2/aetherflux-reservoir) in play (I drew 26 of the 28 cards remaining in my deck, and gained 336 life).

Winner: Tasigur, the Golden Fang

# Game 5

<img src="/images/mtg/2x2-169-aminatou-the-fateshifter.jpg" alt="Aminatou, the Fateshifter" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/clb-647-faldorn-dread-wolf-herald.jpg" alt="Faldorn, Dread Wolf Herald" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/clb-266-baba-lysaga-night-witch.jpg" alt="Baba Lysaga, Night Witch" width="180"/>

This was the last game of the day, the game progressed as normal. Brian was controlling the game with Aminatou and [Hostage Taker](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/227/hostage-taker), blinking it and returning our commanders to the command zone. After removing Hostage Taker, Brian managed to land a [Venser, the Sojourner](https://scryfall.com/card/ddi/1/venser-the-sojourner) and [Teleporation Circle](https://scryfall.com/card/afr/39/teleportation-circle), to increase the blink shenanigans with [Aether Channeler](https://scryfall.com/card/dmu/42/aether-channeler). All the while, he wasn't removing [Baba Lysaga, Night Witch](https://scryfall.com/card/clb/525/baba-lysaga-night-witch), so I was constantly draining both of them for 6 life with [Bastion of Rememberance](https://scryfall.com/card/iko/73/bastion-of-remembrance) and [Gixian Puppeteer](https://scryfall.com/card/bro/328/gixian-puppeteer).

With Brian at 9 life and Gerf at 7, Brian casted an [Out of Time](https://scryfall.com/card/mh2/23/out-of-time) phasing out all our creatures for 15 turns. Unfortunately for them, I was sandbagging an [Assassin's Trophy](https://scryfall.com/card/2x2/175/assassins-trophy) to remove the enchantment, returning all my creatures before my turn and then I activated [Baba Lysaga, Night Witch](https://scryfall.com/card/clb/525/baba-lysaga-night-witch) to drain them 6 life and then attacked with all my other creatures to finish both of them off.
