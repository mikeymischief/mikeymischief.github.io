This day we started early at 9am, so that we eventually got 2 drafts to play. We decided to use both the Utility Land Draft and the Wildcard Duplicates. I would say both are a resounding success at creating an environment that is more about decks and not cards.

The first draft had 5 players - Mikey, Gerf, Jeddy, Jubee and Brian, and was won by Gerf's Selesnya Aggro deck.

The second draft Jubee had to leave so we only had 4 players. We drafted decks from the left over undrafted cards from the earlier draft and created 4 more packs of 13 cards to complete our decks. Jeddy did leave after his first match, but played out Mikey won with his Boros Artifact Aggro deck.

Without further ado, onto the decklists!

# The Morning Draft (Draft #1)


## Jubee's Deck - [Mono-U Artifacts](https://cubecobra.com/cube/deck/5f5d7ecfed60231051651f02)

<img src="/images/mtg/leb-249-icy-manipulator.jpg" alt="Icy Manipulator" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/eld-317-shimmer-dragon.jpg" alt="Shimmer Dragon" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/leb-55-counterspell.jpg" alt="Counterspell" width="200"/>

Jubee's deck looks to control the game with blue's signature cards and an **Icy Manipulator**. Once he's wrestled control of the game, then he can drop a *hexproof* **Shimmer Dragon** to quickly end the game. At least that looked like the gameplan, but unfortunately that never happened in any of the games. There was not enough emphasis on interacting in the early game so Jubee could never control the late game.

## Mikey's Deck - [Rakdos Aggro](https://cubecobra.com/cube/deck/5f5d7908ed6023105164d61e)

<img src="/images/mtg/dka-64-gravecrawler.jpg" alt="Gravecrawler" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/ss3-8-young-pyromancer.jpg" alt="Young Pyromancer" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/pf19-1-lightning-bolt.jpg" alt="Lightning Bolt" width="200"/>

<img src="/images/decks/200912_Rakdos_Aggro.jpg" alt="Rakdos Aggro" width="600"/>

This deck was too ambitious. The first cut was a grixis build that stumbled on blue mana too much, which lead to many of the losses in games. Editing the deck to a Rakdos build looks like it would succeed much better and would put pressure on many of the opponents.

## Jeddy's Deck - [Golgari Midrange](https://cubecobra.com/cube/deck/5f5d7c9aed6023105164f418)

<img src="/images/mtg/isd-105-liliana-of-the-veil.jpg" alt="Liliana of the Veil" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/eld-160-gilded-goose.jpg" alt="Gilded Goose" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/exo-129-survival-of-the-fittest.jpg" alt="Survival of the Fittest" width="200"/>

<img src="/images/decks/200912_Golgari_Midrange.jpg" alt="Golgari Midrange" width="600"/>

This is a midrange deck with not much focus. It plays a bunch of green and black cards with some **Survival of the Fittest** creatures synergies, but ones that didn't interact with the graveyard too much. Originally, the deck was a **Birthing Pod** deck but also didn't employ many of the tool box creatures known in that deck. Jeddy was wise to change this to a generic midrange build, he got more wins because of it.

----

## Brian's Deck - [Dimir Artifacts](https://cubecobra.com/cube/deck/5f5d7ab3ed6023105164e2fc)

<img src="/images/mtg/mbs-97-tezzeret-agent-of-bolas.jpg" alt="Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/aer-181-walking-ballista.jpg" alt="Walking Ballista" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/thb-90-eat-to-extinction.jpg" alt="Eat to Extinction" width="200"/>

<img src="/images/decks/200912_Dimir_Artifacts.jpg" alt="Dimir Artifacts" width="600"/>

With a P1P1 **Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas** pick, the drafting was pretty simple - take artifacts. With the plan in motion to maximize Tezzeret, it didn't fail Brian for most of the day. Looking at the build now, it's not as daunting as I initially gave it credit for. It wasn't built particularly well, I think most of the victories had to be based off the power of Tezzeret and just the artifact synergies with key removal at the right time. Getting lucky helps a bunch too; every dog has their day!

## Gerf's Deck - [Selesnya Aggro](https://cubecobra.com/cube/deck/5f5d747aed60231051649305)

<img src="/images/mtg/dka-24-thalia-guardian-of-thraben.jpg" alt="Thalia, Guardian of Thraben" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/c14-50-titania-protector-of-argoth.jpg" alt="Titania, Protector of Argoth" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/rna-29-unbreakable-formation.jpg" alt="Unbreakable Foramtion" width="200"/>

<img src="/images/decks/200912_Selesnya_Aggro.jpg" alt="Selesnya Aggro" width="600"/>

This deck looks really good. It has a solid plan going in that attacks opponents going wide and with a +1/+1 counter theme to go tall as well. Then in the late game, if anyone has managed to quell the Selesnya forces, **Titania, Protector of Argoth** synergies with the lands to create an army of 5/3 Elementals is as sound as any. This definitely is the best deck for the first pod!

# The Afternoon Draft (Draft #2)


## Jeddy's Deck - [Grixis Midrange](https://cubecobra.com/cube/deck/5f5d856ded602310516556a1)

<img src="/images/mtg/mh1-206-kess-dissident-mage.jpg" alt="Kess, Dissident Mage" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/2xm-334-jace-the-mind-sculptor.jpg" alt="Jace, the Mind Sculptor" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/kld-67-torrential-gearhulk.jpg" alt="Torrential Gearhulk" width="200"/>

<img src="/images/decks/200912_2_Grixis_Midrange.jpg" alt="Grixis Midrange" width="600"/>

Another midrange special from Jeddy. This looks to maximize **Kess, Dissident Mage** to replay spells over and over. At least that loks to be the idea, but the draft doesn't tell the same story. There's a bunch of high casting cost creatures with no way to accelerate that, some meddling disruption that doesn't synergize with spells and creatures with ETB abilties, that again, don't have anything to do with what this Grixis shell should be doing. No wonder Jeddy got out early!

----

## Gerf's Deck - [Izzet Tempo](https://cubecobra.com/cube/deck/5f5d83f7ed60231051654d5d)

<img src="/images/mtg/rtr-172-izzet-charm.jpg" alt="Izzet Charm" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/iko-342-rielle-the-everwise.jpg" alt="Rielle, the Everwise" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/eld-39-brazen-borrower.jpg" alt="Brazen Borrower" width="200"/>

<img src="/images/decks/200912_2_Izzet_Tempo.jpg" alt="Izzet Tempo" width="600"/>

Looks like Gerf laid an egg on this draft. He said that he was originally trying to draft a different archetype, but had to switch mid draft and that doesn't usually bode well. With 2 halves of a deck each, doesn't equal a whole deck to play. Gerf complained of durdling too much without much of an end goal and his games seem to have played out to that effect.

----

## Brian's Deck - [Selesnya Midrange](https://cubecobra.com/cube/deck/5f5d81cced6023105165461e)

<img src="/images/mtg/m10-4-baneslayer-angel.jpg" alt="Baneslayer Angel" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/m21-288-basri-s-lieutenant.jpg" alt="Basri's Lieutenant" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/isd-6-champion-of-the-parish.jpg" alt="Champion of the Parish" width="200"/>

<img src="/images/decks/200912_2_Selesnya_Midrange.jpg" alt="Selesnya Midrange" width="600"/>

This is a decent deck, but it's mostly a midrange pile of cards that got Brian 2 match wins. The powerful cards carry him to victory with several matches relying on Elspeth to jump targets to take out large swaths of life (Vengevine + Rancor + +3/+3 and Flying will kill all but the most prepared).

----

## Mikey's Deck - [Boros Artifact Aggro](https://cubecobra.com/cube/deck/5f5d800ded60231051653cf4)

<img src="/images/mtg/dtk-169-zurgo-bellstriker.jpg" alt="Zurgo Bellstriker" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/kld-231-scrapheap-scrounger.jpg" alt="Scrapheap Scrounger" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/m15-145-goblin-rabblemaster.jpg" alt="Goblin Rabblemaster" width="200"/>

<img src="/images/decks/200912_2_Boros_Artifact_Aggro.jpg" alt="Boros Artifact Aggro" width="600"/>

The winning deck from the afternoon draft, is one with a solid game plan; attack! Mostly a Boros aggro deck with heavy artifact synergies (Someone stole my Court Hussar!). A very low curve and several ways to mitigate sweepers, this deck had it all. In the middle of pack 3 was when I started drafting cards just to mitigate the feel-bads of said sweepers. In addition, Smuggler's Copter for some deck velocity and sweeper insurance (Gideon Blackblade as well!). With only 2 actual spells in this deck and ways to interact, I had to put pressure on the opponents and keep them on the back foot at all times! One criticism of the deck was that **Winota, Joiner of Forces** wasn't a great fit. Which I assumed I had some other Human synergies, but it was only actually on 1 or 2 cards. That said, I should've removed **Winota, Joiner of Forces** and put in more burn.

Overall, it was a great day to play 2 drafts. It was also Gerf's Birthday, so we got to celebrate with champagne from Brian and Domino's Pizza from Jubee!
