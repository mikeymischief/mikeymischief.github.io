Alrighty, it's been almost 3 months since our last draft and since then 2 sets have dropped from Wizards; Strixhaven and Modern Horizons 2. Strixhaven didn't add a lot of cards, but many of them were powerful enough to include. A lot of the Mystical Archive cards were already present, so there wasn't a lot to glean from that.

With more cards from Modern Horizons, how does the draft archetypes change? Which decks will emerge from new cards being added to the draft pool? Who will navigate the draft and win games to take home the trophy!?

Modern Horizons 2 added about 20 cards in the cube, changing it for the better! Many archetypes get even more definition and even powering up fledgling archtypes. Boros Artifact Aggro, more artifacts for the grixis colors and throwbacks to some classic cards from the past, powered up for the modern metagame!

Timeless Dragon, Timeless Witness, Flametongue Yearling help create texture to the cube while evoking nostagia for older cards that may have already left (Eternal Dragon, I'm looking at you!). Many other cards are just exciting from all the synergy endpoints already built into the cube! Grist, the Hunger Tide just has so many exiting applications being a creature/planeswalker, it seems custom built for my cube!

We started at 10am after some commander games and only really had time for a single draft. With Brick and Flour (mexican food) as our lunch break, from draft to playing the games went from 10:30am to 3pm. We drafted 5 packs of 10 cards (which I think is a good amount for how I build color packs).

The draft order:
Mikey -> Jeddy -> Gerf -> Brian

I won the draft with a Grixis artifact control deck. Jeddy finished second with a Simic Tempo deck, followed by gerf's Abzan graveyard deck. Finally, Brian finished last with a Naya aggro deck. Is the fixing a bit too much? There were 3 decks that went for 3-colors and only a single 2-color deck. Maybe the draft pool had a bunch of lands, or maybe people didn't find their lane until later and were forced to play 3 colors. I think the sample size is a bit too small to base cube changes on this single draft.

> "Who says blue isn't strong?!"

The top 2 decks were primarily blue, quelling thoughts that blue is only a "supporting" color. I've always had faith, as I try to play blue when I can, but I always play what the packs dictate.

|       | Mikey | Gerf  | Jeddy | Brian |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Mikey |       |  2-1  |  2-1  |  2-1  |
| Gerf  |  1-2  |       |  1-2  |  2-1  |
| Jeddy |  1-2  |  2-1  |       |  2-1  |
| Brian |  1-2  |  1-2  |  1-2  |       |

## Mikey's Deck - [Grixis Artifact Control](https://cubecobra.com/cube/deck/60da0e7d1712e56b7958c86b)

![Grixis Artifact Control](/images/decks/210627_Mikey_Grixis.jpg "Grixis Artifact Control")

My first match was against Brian and his Naya "aggro" deck. With several ways to sweep the board (Anger of the Gods, Radiant Flames, Damnation) and many other ways to just control the game (Electrolyze, Arc Lightning), my only issue is with winning the game. I don't expect to win with outright attacking, so I drafted Thassa's Oracle pretty highly as I thought it _could_ be my win condition. Little did I know, it would be the primary way I'd be winning my games. Just prolonging the game with a control deck, you can just play a Value Thassa's Oracle, but I had many ways to speed up this process. Mesmeric Orb was the fastest way to get there, but the _surveil_ from Master of Death was helpful, as well as just drawing cards (Dig Through Time, Thought Monitor). I've even milled out people with Mesmeric Orb (I wonder if anyone sided in more cards to counter this).

My loss to brian happened with I cast Damnation on his 2 larger creatures (they were dominating the battlefield) into a _instant_ Secure the Wastes for 5. With that, I couldn't find another sweeper and lost the game.

Despite my winning all 3 matches, every game was pretty close. If I hadn't had the plan of Thassa's Oracle, which caught many of my opponents off-guard, every game could've gone either way.

Some cards that played well for me: Thought Monitor, despite having only 1 artifact on board, in a control deck, Thought Monitor was excellent. I should think about playing Mulldrifter a bit more in control. Putting some sweepers in red was a good choice to allow 3 colors to play control, as it really widens the playable archetypes for many colors. This was one of my best Dig Through Time decks as it was very easy to generate a graveyard-filling velocity. This final decklist has Hostage Taker, but that was only in my deck based on the last match up I was playing with Gerf.

I also had near perfect mana as it seems I may have been the only one in the grixis shard, which allowed me to splash BB for Damnation and Vraska's Contempt without any worry.

## Jeddy's Deck - [Simic Tempo](https://cubecobra.com/cube/deck/60da0d391712e56b7958c010)

<img src="/images/mtg/2xm-334-jace-the-mind-sculptor.jpg" alt="Jace, the Mind Scupltor" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/mor-55-vendilion-clique.jpg" alt="Vendilion Clique" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/rna-122-biogenic-ooze.jpg" alt="Biogenic Ooze" width="200"/>

![Simic Tempo](/images/decks/210627_Jeddy_Simic.jpg "Simic Tempo")

Another cube draft another second place for Jeddy. He's pretty consistently finishing second in the last couple drafts. Last time he took it down he had a Jeskai based tempo deck with some control elements. He kept telling me that I was wrong in my assessment that he was playing control. This deck, is a tempo deck that leans to play a lot of creatures early and apply pressure. With Brazen Borrower and Vendilion Clique, Jeddy has plenty of opportunity to maximize his mana in the early game.

If the game goes long, he has Biogenic Ooze (see the board state in the picture above) and Stormwing Entity to finish off opponents.

His deck is solid all around, has a familiar game plan of trying to out tempo his opponent, but this time he's using blue to keep his enemy off-kilter while his little dorks get in for damage. Jeddy's quickly becoming the tempo guy, just like I've been playing the control decks of the format. Jeddy knows one style and he plays it well.

## Gerf's Deck - [Abzan Graveyard](https://cubecobra.com/cube/deck/60da0bc61712e56b7958aedd)

<img src="/images/mtg/soi-245-the-gitrog-monster.jpg" alt="The Gitrog Monster" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/2xm-342-dark-confidant.jpg" alt="Dark Confidant" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/apc-126-vindicate.jpg" alt="Vindicate" width="200"/>

![Abzan Graveyard](/images/decks/210628_Gerf_Abzan.jpg "Abzan Graveyard")

Talking with Gerf about his deck, he was in the middle of several archetypes: +1/+1 Counters, Golgari Graveyard synergies and Orzhov Humans. His deck does have a great plan of trying to push out damage early and then have several ways to get back his creatures from the graveyard if someone happens to stop him. The deck looks pretty lean, I think we can chalk it up to some variance that he didn't perform better. I would trade a couple of his 5-drops for some 3-drops to really apply pressure.

With a great set of removal and a plan for the late game, this Abzan deck seems pretty solid.

## Brian's Deck - [Naya Midrange](https://cubecobra.com/cube/deck/60da09931712e56b79589d16)

<img src="/images/mtg/tsr-365-primeval-titan.jpg" alt="Primeval Titan" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/rav-117-char.jpg" alt="Char" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/mh2-315-ragavan-nimble-pilferer.jpg" alt="Ragavan, Nimble Pilferer" width="200"/>

![Naya Midgrange](/images/decks/210627_Brian_Naya.jpg "Naya Midrange")

Brian's deck looks pretty good, but as an aggro deck it needed way more presence early. There are several one drops but only a single 2-drop. The removal suite is a bit expensive and would've worked had the deck contained many low casting cost creatures. That said, with a glut of 4-drop creatures, this build was stuck between 2 macro theaters; aggro and midrange.

Without a solid plan and a mixture of different archetypes, his deck could perform like either, but more often than not, would perform somewhere in the middle. If you draw the wrong half (like say the midrange side) and keep a 2-lander, you could get mana screwed for a game (or 2!)

Many of Brian's games did have some mana problems, so he raised the amount of lands to 18 to try and offset this inherent issue. But Brian is learning how to build competitive decks, so soon enough he may be competing for a cube Trophy!
