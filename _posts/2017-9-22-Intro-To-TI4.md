Introduction to the races of Twilight Imperium:

![The Barony of Letnev]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/races/Letnev.jpg "The Barony of Letnev")
THE BARONY OF LETNEV
In a word: Military industrialists

Background: A militaristic race that makes its home on a rocky asteroid floating in the darkness of space.  The Letnev are focused on the colonization of other lesser developed worlds and impose strict bureaucracy and discipline on those worlds.  As a subterranean race, they have a weakness to light.  Only those in the military who have achieved great victories may advance to the highest levels of society.  The Letnev are very ambitious and they are not afraid to use their military to achieve their ambitions.  The more war, the more glory.

Pros/Cons: Can have a bigger fleet than others, can exchange trade goods for a temporary boost in combat, poor trade agreements, excellent home system, good starting fleet.

Style: For the player militarily aggressive to the maximum with little regard for politics and trade (except maybe by coercion).


THE EMIRATES OF HACAN

In a word: Mercantilists

Background: These space lions are the masters of trade.  Your smugglers and traders have infiltrated every corner of the galaxy.  If there's any business going on in the galaxy, it's guaranteed that you have your paws in it. The Hacan always have an abundance of trade goods and have the power to help out other races or to hurt them severely when trade is involved.  The Hacan never have to worry about having enough resources to build units and can use their trade good to bribe other races to agree with their policies.  Nothing personal, it's just business.

Pros/Cons: Can trade action cards, don't need trade master's permission to forge trade agreements, get bonus trade goods, excellent trade agreements, good home system (3 planets!), decent starting fleet.

Style: Master of trade. For the player who wants to forge an economic powerhouse, doing lots of wheeling-and-dealing on the diplomatic stage, but still nothing to sniff at warfare-wise, since all that filthy lucre can be used to build massive fleets. 


THE FEDERATION OF SOL 

In a word: Colonizers

Background: One of the newest races to enter the Imperium, and also one of the first to rebel against it; the Twilight Wars were touched-off when a Sol fleet opened fire of the Barony of Letnev's blockade of the Quann wormhole. The humans represent the most numerous and most diverse species of the galaxy.

Pros/Cons:  Can deploy free ground troops each turn, receive bonus command counters, good trade agreements, decent homeworld, mediocre starting fleet.

Style: For the player who isn't entirely sure what his style is, or who likes to be a jack-of-all-trades; well-rounded, flexible, and adaptable.



THE L1Z1X MINDNET

In a Word: Warlike cyborgs

Background: The remnants of the Lazax, ancient rulers of the Imperium, returned in cyborg form thirsty for revenge. They come from their remote, wealthy world, a nightmare planet of technology ready to reclaim the empire they fled from generations ago.

Pros/Cons: Cheaper and more powerful dreadnaughts, twice as much starting techonology as everyone else (save the Universities of Jol-Nar), poor trade agreements, good home system, powerful starting fleet.

Style: For a player who wants to play a military aggressive style, but without the need to be quite as aggressive as Letnev since you've got good technology and strong Dreadnoughts. 



THE MENTAK COALITION

In a word: Space pirates

Background: The rag-tag inhabitants of a prison-planet who overthrew their Lazax masters when the Imperium began to crumble, and now terrorize the space-lanes with lightening raids, taking what they want then leaving.

Pros/Cons: Can steal trade goods from other players, get free shots before battle begins, poor trade agreements, decent homeworld, strong starting fleet.

Style: For the player who doesn't mind pissing-off the other players via dirty tricks like stealing trade goods and striking out for aggressive raids with their cruisers (which get a sneak attack before enemy can shoot back).



THE SARDAKK N'ORR

In a word: Warrior bugs

Background: Repugnant insectoids who inhabit massive skyscrapers on their crowded homeworlds surrounded by great network of orbital space stations and massive complements of fleet units.

Pros/Cons: Get +1 to all combat rolls, decent trade agreements, mediocre home system, decent starting fleet. No starting technology (A lot of objectives require you to have technologies), hard for them to keep up.

Style: For the players who likes the idea of swarming the enemy with lots of cheap ships that hit harder than anyone else's ship-for-ship.



THE UNIVERSITIES OF JOL'NAR 

In a word: Technologists 

Background: Although physically weak and aquatic, the Hylar (inhabitants of the twin planets Jol and Nar) are a proud people, often to the point of abrasiveness and arrogance. In the Imperium of old they were the chief technologists and now utilize the resources of they homeworlds building a secret force with which their will replace the Lazax as rulers of the galaxy. 

Pros/Cons: -1 to all combat rolls, can re-roll dice, can get free tech everytime the Technology card is played, twice as much starting techonology as everyone else, good trade agreements, mediocre home system, mediocre starting fleet.

Style: Advancing your technologies will give you a big advantage over other races later in the game.  Lay low and be friendly at the beginning, but once your technological machine is built, it will be tough for other races to withstand your power.




THE XXCHA KINGDOM

In a Word: Politicians

Background: One of the first great civilizations of the galaxy.  These space turtles are peaceful and prefer to solve problems through diplomacy rather than through violence.  In the fall of the Empire, they were caught weaponless and defenseless, which led to the destruction of one of their home worlds.  Although they prefer the path of peace, the Xxcha do not want to suffer such a tragedy again.  Therefore, they have focused on developing strong defenses.  In order to insure a peaceful galaxy for future generations, the Xxcha have no choice but to take the Imperial throne for themselves and make war a thing of the past.

Pros/Cons: Can veto political agendas, enemies get a -1 to hit in the first round of combat against them, good trade agreements, mediocre home system, weak starting fleet.

Style: For someone who prefers political wrangling to brute force, but with a decent stick to beat people with using a defensive military, waiting for that perfect moment to strike.




THE EMBERS OF MUAAT

In a word: Fire people

Background: The Embers of Muaat are a mysterious race.  Their bodies are always on fire, so no one has seen them outside of their specially constructed suits which they have built to interact with other races.  In the past, the Muaat were enslaved by the Jol Nar to develop a technology to convert energy into mass.  The Muaat eventually rebelled against the Jol Nar, and in the process took control of a Jol Nar prototype--the War Sun.  Armed with this super weapon, the Muaat have sworn never to be enslaved again.  To ensure this, they will use their War Sun to take control of the galaxy.

Pros/Cons: The start the game with a War Sun, can move through supernovas, their War Suns can spawn fighters without a space dock, good trade agreements, mediocre home system, start the game with a War Sun although the rest of their fleet is weak.

Style: For the cautious player who wants to be left alone in the early game (having a War Sun will have that effect on neighbours), yet able to play with some finesse as the Embers are not considered one of the strongest races.




THE YIN BROTHERHOOD

In a word: Warrior Zealots

Background: Genetically-modified fanatic adherents of a bizarre cult centred around long-dead scientist named Darien who illegally cloned hundreds of his children in an effort to save his wife from a deadly disease who now seek to bind all to their religion.

Pros/Cons: Beasts in ground combat, can do kamikaze runs to destroy enemy ships, poor trade agreements, poor home system, very strong starting fleet.

Style: Another race for a very aggressive style of play. Can convert enemies.




THE CLAN OF SAAR

In a word: Warrior Space gypsies 

Background: A highly mobile and nomadic race.  They don't stay in any one place for long.  They pick up and move everything with them.  These nomads have long been kicked around by more established races, but this has made the Clan strong.  The Clan is at home anywhere and are good at salvaging on planets they conquer.  Now that the Clan is strong, it is time to take some bigger prizes--perhaps the biggest one of all, Mecatol Rex.

Pros/Cons: Have mobile star bases, can still collect victory points if their home system is occupied, gain bonus trade goods for capturing planets, good trade agreements, rubbish home system, good starting fleet.

Style: For a player looking to play a subtle and crafty game, utilizing mobility and trade goods to gain influence in the galaxy.




THE NAALU COLLECTIVE

In a word: Telepathic Snakes

Background: The Naalu are a race of snake women.  They have remained hidden from the rest of the galaxy for much of its history.  It turns out that the Naalu are highly telepathic, with the ability to wipe the minds and control those who get too close to their secrets.  They tend not to speak and communicate through telepathy.  The Naalu highly value beauty.  Their home world of Druaa is a veritable paradise.  When Naalu look at other species and other world, they only see chaos and ugliness.  Now is the time for the rest of the universe to submit to the order, tranquility, and beauty of the Naalu Collective.  If they will not submit, they will be destroyed.

Pros/Cons: A truly impressive starting fleet. The Naalu are also slippery little suckers – they always go first every round and can retreat from any space battle before it begins without suffering casualties. Their fighters also receive bonuses during combat, ensuring that most opponents are going to surrounded and swarmed to death by pesky little ships.

Style: Players with the confidence to go first to subtly dictate the flow and tempo of the game.




THE YSSARIL TRIBES

In a word: Sneaky chameleon-like goblins

Background: Long ago, the ancient race of the Lazax ruled the cosmos. In a back corner of the galaxy, the Lazax colonized the smallish planet Retillion, harvesting the delicious menn root that grew there. For awhile, things were fantastic on Retillion – until the sneaky, aboriginal, green goblins that lived in the shadows there systematically kicked some Lazax butt. Over the eons, the various tribes of the Yssaril adapted to Lazax technology and took the stars, using subterfuge, stealth and their superior spies to spread like vermin throughout the colonized territories.

Pros/Cons: Subterfuge. The Yssaril are the masters of the secret attack and sabotage. They draw one additional Action card per round, which means they are privy to a wealth of surprise powers, advantages and tricks. The Yssaril can also sneak a peek at one other opponent’s Action cards each round, providing them with very valuable information which they can use to subtly kick some butt at just the right moment.

Style: Information junkies and those players who like to play a conniving, cerebral game of cat & mouse.
 


THE WINNU

In a word: Custodians of the ancient empire

Background: Now that the empire has fallen and the imperial race has disappeared from the universe, the Winnu have upheld the lore, tradition, and culture of the old empire.  Although they had hoped that the imperial race would return and restore the glory of the empire, they have started to lose hope in that dream.  Now many of the Winnu feel that they are the rightful successors to the Empire.  Now is the time to put an end to this age of chaos and return the universe to it's former glory.  The Winnu will protect and honor the heritage of the empire forever.

Pros/Cons: The Winnu always add the influence of their home system planet to votes, even if the home system planet has been exhausted.  This gives them a bit more political power than other races.  Also, if they have at least one ground force on a planet, it is immune from the Local Unrest Action card.  This prevents you from losing planets due to this pesky card.  Finally, you don't need to spend a command counter to execute the secondary ability of the Technology Strategy.  This gives you a minor boost in developing technologies.

Style: Everything centers around controlling Mecatol Rex with this race.



THE NEKRO VIRUS

In a word: Psychotic Machines

Background: 

Pros/Cons: Can assimilate technology from the opponent.

Style: 



THE GHOSTS OF CREUSS

In a word: worm-hole beings of energy and light

Background: The Shaleri are mysterious beings of energy and light. Not much is known about this race except they show masterful control over strange sciences and materials. Storytellers tell tales that the Ghosts of Cruess have come forth for some sinister purpose yet to be revealed. Many believe the Shaleri are civilized and polite, yet they are also regarded as exceptionally secretive, ritualistic and prickly on a wide range of matters. It's generally undecided whether their behavior is one to be expected of a race so recently introduced to the material galaxy, or whether these are signs that something more ominous lurks beneath their brooding metal helmets.

Pros/Cons: 

Style: The Ghosts of Creuss are a very mobile race as they can maniuplate worm-holes or the areas around them to their needs.

THE ARBOREC

In a word: Sentient plants

Background: 

Pros/Cons: They can grow entire spaceships from themselves.

Style: 






I guess the best races are either: Clan of Saar, Arborec, Nekro, Mentak, Naalu Or Nekro, Mentak, Naalu, Sol, L1Z1X
See below:
Clan of Saar with space docks is very strong now. You can retreat with them. You can build right after moving. No need for logistical thinking, build it where you need it. And when you conquer planets, you get extra trade goods.
Similarly with Arborec. Just move and build. Place GFs on planets as backup. Not sure which race is stronger here. Maybe Saar with the extra capacity on the space docks. But Arborec also has to defend the home system. Both neighbors would have to keep the plants at bay.
Then again, these two races could be blown apart by 3xDestroyerII-s and a decent fleet to back it up. Yin would probably focus on destroyers. Or Sardakk N'orr if they are your neighbors. Not sure about that. So these 2 races could be either very strong or just decent.
Nekro is more or less the same but it can gain a bit more technologies than before. Since Command Counters are so rare in the new edition, I imagine Nekro would intentionally take Technology himself to get 3 CCs, maybe even spend another 6 resources to get another 3 CCs. Seems like this abuse would benefit Nekro much more than picking Leadership. That's why Nekro would be much stronger in this game.
Mentak is mostly same as before. Can get CruiserII as 2nd tech, could get war suns quickly. Could also go for racial techs. I think it depends whether you can get a planet with a tech specialty and what type, anything but blue. The starting fleet is a bit weak. Hard to expand. Very Nekro-like hit-and-run tactics. Best flagship IMO. Works against Letnev, L1Z1X and anyone who builds War Suns. My favorite race so I am a bit biased.
Naalu is still strong, a bit weaker than before, I think. 0 Initiative is always powerful. If they can get the racial techs, no-one would want to attack them.
Sol can have bigger fighter screens than others. Also the extra Command Counter is super useful. Seems like most races would prefer to get the tech which gives extra Command Counters. The flagship can carry 12 units! That could be stupidly strong. Also all the infantry bonuses, it seems like this race is more about numbers than anyone else. Having the production and logistics to get the swarm anywhere is going to be hard, especially when there is a Saar Ball of Death rolling around regenerating all the time.
L1Z1X Dreadnoughts are super nice now. And they can bombard every round during ground invasion. That is incredibly powerful en masse. No need to carry that much infantry anymore. Just nuke it from orbit. If you are lucky and can get a yellow tech planet, you could get Inheritance System and get any tech by the 3rd round. War Suns or better Dreadnoughts? The flagship is strong.
Letnev is mostly same as before. If they can hoard trade goods, they could really shine in combat. In large battles, being able to reroll all missed dice is huge. Very nice production at home too.
Jol-Nar can build a lot of tech as before. Not sure if it negates the -1 to combat rolls.
Yssaril is still strong with the extra action cards. Then again, he does not really have get that many action cards per round. The expanding force is quite strong though.
Hacan seems quite strong by itself. I guess you can trade in the beginning but once you start getting ahead, other players will just stop trading with you. The 3-planet home system is nice and all but if your only special ability is eliminated, you're going to fall behind.
Xxcha can turtle a lot. That's mostly it. Based on the public objectives, that might be better than it sounds. The flagship with 4 space docks in one system could defend 7 systems simultaneously. 8 hits (with first red tech) before combat to anyone who gets near you.
Muaat is a bit stronger than before. Getting War Sun with movement of 3 is much easier now. Seems like getting War Sun is not that important for other races - they have other things going on. Jol-Nar and Mentak could because they are already half-way there.
Sardakk N'orr starts with no techs. A lot of objectives require you to have technologies. So if you are not lucky with the objective deck, you are fucked. Starting with 2 carriers is nice though.
Yin is OK. Nothing that great about them. Not sure if stronger than other races. The ability to sacrifice units to kill enemy ships could pay off in small-sized battles.
Creuss can be all over the map easily. Not sure if that is good or not. Overextending with them can be really easy.
Winnu is super weak now. Where to start... The only thing it has going for it is controlling Mecatol Rex. If it doesn't it has nothing. Starting with only one technology which can be chosen at the beginning of the game. The starting fleet moves slowly. You can reach MR by round 3. Maybe round 2 if lucky and you get Warfare. The other players can still stop you from reaching MR at relatively low costs. First, during the galaxy creation phase they can just place the supernova between Winnu HS and MR. This adds 2 movement to reach MR. Another thing they can do is to move their faster ships to hover over MR so you wouldn't get it. Mentak and Jol Nar would probably research Cruiser II so moving in there is quite easy for them. And then they can take it whenever they want to. Yeah, you could buy some techs to speed you up but by then the opponents could already be swarming MR. Since your starting fleet honestly sucks, you can not justify rushing MR. Maybe you will get there by round 4. By then EVERYONE already wants to take MR anyway. You getting there first to be immediately kicked out is not worth it but that's the only thing that makes you different from others.
