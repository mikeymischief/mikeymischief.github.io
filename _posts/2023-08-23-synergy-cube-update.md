It's been over 3 years since I've spoken about my high-powered synergy cube.

A lot has changed since the initial post in 2020, and a lot of narrow archetypes have been removed for a more open-style draft where players are not channeled into lanes because of their color pair. It's still a cube high on interaction with a focus on creature combat, but allows the expressiveness of building a deck to one's preference. In general, there are a lot more artifacts in the colored sections of the cube, bringing a rise to the amount of synergy and angles a player can build a deck. There are also a lot less narrow payoffs and more encouraging of 2-color decks that can splash for a 3rd color. Finally, there are a bunch of changes for the draft portions to enable single-card archetypes shine, like, having the duplicate voucher system and adding a triome for 3-color pip creatures.

Overall, I want the cube to have the gameplay of Modern in the early 00s. That was when Magic was a game of incremental advantages and learning when you push those into a victory. Today's game, is much about playing haymaker after haymaker, making the gameplay more about presenting incredable threats that must be removed or risk losing the game. Having the games play out to a degree where you do get some breathing room to adapt to the play styles of the opponent and having each game piece have some counterplay, makes games interesting and fun. Being able to play a linear deck with very little interaction or the "Two ships passing through the night" style game is not rewarding to say the least. The changes to the cube have reflected these game design goals since then.

With the preamble out of the way, let's get into the meat and potatoes!

## The Death of Narrow Archetypes

Some of the archetypes I was excited about have been removed since the last article was published. Selesnya Tokens, while interesting, I felt just gummed up the board and didn't actually proactively end the game. I feel that way for many "token" decks, which is also why Boros tokens aren't a thing. Any design where the tokens "can't block", is a plus in my book. As you will see below, it's taken a while to get to, but I feel Selesnya is in a good place at the moment.

Dimir Ninjas is also another archetype that has been long gone. It was extrememly narrow and many of the pieces were only to supplement this deck. It kinda had some synergy with WU blink since the _ninjutsu_ brought back the original creature to hand, but no other deck is really drafting the payoffs. It was a sad realization, but ultimately those pieces went into a commander deck (which also, was much too linear for my taste).


## Archetypes
----

### Azorius Control
<img src="/images/mtg/2xm-334-jace-the-mind-sculptor.jpg" alt="Jace, the Mind Sculptor" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/lrw-56-cryptic-command.jpg" alt="Cryptic Command" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/ktk-36-dig-through-time.jpg" alt="Dig Through Time" width="200"/>

Azorius Control is a classic deck archetype that still is a pillar of the modern environment. This deck seeks to control the early game and then win late game with some form of inevitability. Packing your deck with Wrath of God or Supreme Verdict, and then some draw spells in order to get them on time, like Dig Through Time or Memory Deluge are keys to victory. Pairing your wraths with planeswalkers is especially heinous. Once you're wrestled control you can win with pretty much anything, especially lands like Hall of Storm Giants help you hit those land drops early game, then give you a win condition late. Torrential Gearhulk flashing back a Swords to Plowshares is another great way stop an aggro deck from getting their way. You'll need some mana rocks (Mind Stone, Liquimetal Torque) to accelerate yourself to get to your high mana value spells.

Probably the premier control deck in the cube, this archetype will always remain a classic, and for good reason, the cards fit so well together


### Dimir Robots
<img src="/images/mtg/brc-108-herald-of-anguish.jpg" alt="Herald of Anguish" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/brc-120-baleful-strix.jpg" alt="Baleful Strix" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/dmr-423-urza-lord-high-artificer.jpg" alt="Urza, Lord High Artificer" width="200"/>

Dimir Artifacts is a tempo deck with elements of control to help stabilize the game. There are several cards that work with this strategy that benefit the drafter from taking as many artifacts as possible from the blue section. You benefit from a lot of the power of [Urza, Lord High Arificer](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/dmr-423-urza-lord-high-artificer.jpg) to generate fast mana or go-wide with something like [Whirler Rogue](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/brc-101-whirler-rogue.jpg) or [The Antiquities War](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/dom-42-the-antiquities-war.jpg), all the while getting some card advantage with a cheap [Thought Monitor](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/brc-98-thought-monitor.jpg)


### Rakdos Sacrifice
<img src="/images/mtg/2x2-352-blood-artist.jpg" alt="Blood Artist" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/tmp-179-goblin-bombardment.jpg" alt="Goblin Bombardment" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/war-204-mayhem-devil.jpg" alt="Mayhem Devil" width="200"/>

This is another contemporary classic. Many of today's Rakdos archetypes revolve around sacrificing your own creatures for value and it's present in this cube as well. Getting paid off to kill your own creatures while killing the opponent or controlling the board with [Braids, Nightmare Adept](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/dmu-84-braids-arisen-nightmare.jpg) and [Priest of Forgotten Gods](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/rna-83-priest-of-forgotten-gods.jpg) advances your boardstate while hindering your opponents. This is the modern day [Smallpox](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/tsp-131-smallpox.jpg) archetype. Oh how I wish that were playbale in cube. These cards also share DNA with the Orzhov stax archetype.


### Gruul Wildfire
<img src="/images/mtg/usg-228-wildfire.jpg" alt="Wildfire" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/5dn-114-crucible-of-worlds.jpg" alt="Crucible of Worlds" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/mh2-416-titania-protector-of-argoth.jpg" alt="Titania, Protector of Argoth" width="200"/>

One of the classic decks, pioneered by Kai Budde's constructed Wildfire deck from the 90s. This iteration is mainly Gruul-based, using green to accelerate your lands in play and red for the either of the [Wildfire](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/usg-228-wildfire.jpg) variants. Wildfire serves to control the board while stopping your opponets mana. You don't necessarily mind destroying your own lands because you have [Crucible of Worlds](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/5dn-114-crucible-of-worlds.jpg) or [Ramunap Excavator](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/hou-129-ramunap-excavator.jpg) to play them back. 

Here is a link to my draft winning 3-0 from a couple years ago: [GR Wildfire](https://cubecobra.com/cube/deck/606cfbcfb9b1e0106a5321a2).

It was one of my favorite decks to ever play in cube and I can only look back in fondness.


### Selesnya Landfall
<img src="/images/mtg/znr-292-felidar-retreat.jpg" alt="Felidar Retreat" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/aer-133-renegade-rallier.jpg" alt="Renegade Rallier" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/inv-189-harrow.jpg" alt="Harrow" width="200"/>

Selesnya Landfall is a deck that hasn't come together, but the pieces are present in the cube. The idea is that you play a bunch of landfall payoffs, and then draft things that generate landfall, or use the white creatures to bring back lands from the graveyard. You can use [Primeval Titan](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/tsr-365-primeval-titan.jpg) or [Life from the Loam](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/uma-172-life-from-the-loam.jpg) in green, [Knight of the Reliquary](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/tsr-379-knight-of-the-reliquary.jpg), [Renegade Rallier](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/aer-133-renegade-rallier.jpg) in selesnya, or [Sun Titan](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/https://scryfall.com/card/m11/35/sun-titan.jpg) in white. By playing all these cards, you can generate some massive turns with 4+ landfall triggers.

Hopefully it won't be a full year until the next time I update this blog for my cube.
