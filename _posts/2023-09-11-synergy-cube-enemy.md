## Archetypes
----

### Orzhov Stax

Another classic archetype that marries black removal and sacrifice enablers with white's token making to really put the squeeze on opponents resources. By having a persistent way of sacrificing things (and eventually, possibly, attacking the landbase), this deck really mess with what the opponent is trying to do. If you mix it with [Crucible of Worlds](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/5dn-114-crucible-of-worlds.jpg) to recover your own lands, or any of the recursive creatures in black [Gravecrawler](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/dka-64-gravecrawler.jpg) and you will definitely relive the days of Dead Guy Ale/Stax. This deck also goes well with any of the artistocrat pieces as sacrificing things and getting an additional benefit can propel you even further ahead of your opponent. The goal is truely to deny the opponent's resources (which is why this also likes to have discard effects) and use that advantage to ride to victory.


### Izzet Artifacts
<img src="/images/mtg/bro-219-saheeli-filigree-master.jpg" alt="Saheeli, Filagree Master" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/brc-101-whirler-rogue.jpg" alt="Whirler Rogue" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/c18-57-retrofitter-foundry.jpg" alt="Retrofitter Foundry" width="200"/>

The Izzet Artifacts deck is a deck based on using the artifact enablers and payoffs into a midrange synergistic deck that can potentially power out a quick robot ([Myr Battlesphere](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/brc-151-myr-battlesphere.jpg), [Cityscape Leveler](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/bro-363-cityscape-leveler.jpg)) or play an attition game to out value opponents. The deck uses the blue and red filtering cards (Consider, Faithless Looting) to get the robots into the graveyard and then can use [Goblin Welder]() to get them out really quick. It also has lines to use the thopter generation ([Whirler Rogue](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/brc-101-whirler-rogue.jpg), [Pia and Kiran Nalaar](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/ori-157-pia-and-kiran-nalaar.jpg), [Saheeli, Filagree Master](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/bro-219-saheeli-filigree-master.jpg)) to create the 1/1s and then use [Retrofitter Foundry](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/c18-57-retrofitter-foundry.jpg) to upgrade them to 4/4 constructs. Sometimes this shell will utilize [Karn, Scion of Urza](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/dom-1-karn-scion-of-urza.jpg) or [Urza, Lord High Artificer](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/dmr-423-urza-lord-high-artificer.jpg) to create the ever-growing construct threat. In addition to those finishers, there is always the coveted [The Antiquities War](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/dom-42-the-antiquities-war.jpg) to get the job done. It's a very rewarding deck to play as the sequencing and decision-making you need to perform in order to maximize your plays can rival even the most complicated decks in the cube!


### Golgari Graveyard
<img src="/images/mtg/fut-153-tarmogoyf.jpg" alt="Tarmogoyf" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/c15-49-meren-of-clan-nel-toth.jpg" alt="Meren of Clan Nel Toth" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/dka-64-gravecrawler.jpg" alt="Gravecrawler" width="200"/>

The Golgari guild in the cube will attract players that like to sacrifice things for value and then recur those things back to out attrition their opponents. Cards like Meren of Clan Nel Toth is an unstoppable force when it can stay on the battlefield as you're either drawing cards or bringing back your dudes when you fill your graveyard. Many of the self-mill elements play well in this deck, cards like [Stitcher's Supplier](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/m19-121-stitcher-s-supplier.jpg) or [Satyr Wayfinder](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/bng-136-satyr-wayfinder.jpg) so that you can [Reanimate](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/tmp-151-reanimate.jpg) them individually or if you're going all-out, you can just [Living Death](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/tmp-142-living-death.jpg). There is also attrition strategies with [Mosswood DreadKnight](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/woe-231-mosswood-dreadknight.jpg) or all the black sacrifice value synergies [The Gitrog Monster](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/soi-245-the-gitrog-monster.jpg) and [Morbid Opportunist](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/mid-113-morbid-opportunist.jpg). Either way, when you're with the Golgari, death is only the beginning!


### Boros Equipment
<img src="/images/mtg/eld-359-embercleave.jpg" alt="Embercleave" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/wwk-20-stoneforge-mystic.jpg" alt="Stoneforge Mystic" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/woe-298-kellan-the-fae-blooded.jpg" alt="Kellan, the Fae-Blooded" width="200"/>

The Boros Equipment deck is a straight aggro deck that uses Equipment in order to quickly defeat opponents. The best of these is [Embercleave](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/eld-359-embercleave.jpg) as it can deal massive amounts of damage in a short period of time. Both Kellan, the Fae-Blooded and Stoneforge Mystic can fetch your best equipment making the performance of this Boros deck consistent enough to be a threat anytime you see any of these cards in the draft. Players can opt-in to the Legends-matter subtheme with cards like [Merry, Esquire of Rohan](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/ltr-437-merry-esquire-of-rohan.jpg) and [Yoshimaru, Ever-Faithful](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/nec-46-yoshimaru-ever-faithful.jpg). The benefits to Boros over the mono color decks is that you will be trading consistency for power. Don't forget that [](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/.jpg) is her own, one-card, archetype!


### Simic Tokens
<img src="/images/mtg/mh2-204-lonis-cryptozoologist.jpg" alt="Lonis, Cryptozoologist" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/woe-193-tough-cookie.jpg" alt="Tough Cookie" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/dom-42-the-antiquities-war.jpg" alt="The Antiquities War" width="200"/>

Who would've ever dreamed that Tough Cookie would become it's own archetype in the cube? This archetype came from a fever dream (and is the most experimental of all the archetypes) about making Food happen in green. That deck stemmed from the fact that green had no access to all the artifact synergies in the cube as it was the lone-standout. But when the Lord of the Rings set was released there seemed to be a critical mass of Food and Food-synergies to make this happen. With Murders at Karlov Manor, this deck will only get better. This archetype takes much of the Food generation in green and the clue generation in blue and mixes them together to make this deck take big turns by attacking with (previously) inanimate objects. The payoffs for token generation make it so you can create 4/4s with enough mana, or wait for the final chapter in The Antiquities War. Individually, you can use [The Blackstaff of Waterdeep](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/afr-365-the-blackstaff-of-waterdeep.jpg) to start the beat down early. You can also play a controlling game since you can gain life off the Food tokens and draw cards from Lonis, Cryptozoologist. In Murders at Karlov Manor, there are going to be even more investigate cards: [Forensic Gadgeteer](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/mkm-57-forensic-gadgeteer.jpg) and [Sharp-Eyed Rookie](https://mikeymischief.github.io/images/mtg/mkm-176-sharp-eyed-rookie.jpg). I'm not sure the power-level is quite there, but since it seems the blue artifact deck can now splash green and give Simic an easy-to-draft archetype. I'm sure as heck willing to try. Taking innocuous little tokens and creating an army is one of the most fun things a player can do in this cube!

-----

That's a sample of decks from the enemy color pairings. As mentioned before, this is only a fraction of the decks that can be built. It's more like these decks are theoretical as the contents of these archetypes are actually controlled by what is seen in a draft. At 420 cards in the cube, if you draft with 8 players, you have an ~86% chance of seeing any individual card. With 6 players (our typical amount of drafters), you see only about 72%. I find that having the cube at about 420 is the perfect amount for the number of average drafters that play. Cultivating a synergy cube means that nearly every draft, you should see most cards in order for the archetypes to really shine.
