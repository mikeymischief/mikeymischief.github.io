# Spring 2021 Cube Draft

Another Cube Draft!

We only got one cube draft in, but we got to play the Innistrad cube draft (decklists not recorded) in the afternoon (followed by some commander afterward). Lunch was again Domino's as we tried to maxmimize the playing time. This draft would see many archetypes no present in any other cube draft.

We drafted a little over half the cube (using the Utility Land Draft), since we only had 4 players this time (Mike, Gerf, Jeddy and Brian). We drafted 6 packs of 9 cards, which I think with 4 players, is best way to draft with this number as it allows many of the archetypes designed with 8 players to somewhat shine with the lower player count. The draft order was:

Mikey -> Brian -> Jeddy -> Gerf

The winning 3-0 deck was my Gruul Wildfire deck, the second place deck was Jeddy's Orzhov Aggro deck (2-1), followed by Gerf's Bant Soulherder list (1-2) and then a 60-card Yorion deck (0-3).

| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Mikey |       |  2-1  |  2-1  |  2-0  |
| Gerf  |  1-2  |       |  1-2  |  2-1  |
| Jeddy |  1-2  |  2-1  |       |  2-1  |
| Brian |  0-2  |  1-2  |  1-2  |       |

![Game Rule Violation](/images/photos/210327_GRV.jpg "Game Rule Violation")
Apparently, Jeddy doesn't read his cards, as he had several Game Rule Violations during the day. He thought Mikaeus, the Lunarch gave each of his creatures the number of counters on Mikaeus (if Mikaeus had 3 +1/+1 counters, activating his ability only gives each creature a single +1/+1 counter, not THREE), which turned his game 2 against Brian around. Jeddy eventually conceded that he probably would've lost that game, if he read Mikaeus correctly.

## Mikey's Deck - [Wildfire Control](https://www.cubecobra.com/cube/deck/60602917a0f0791063d31e8a)

[![Wildfire Control](/images/decks/210327_Mikey_Wildfire.jpg "Wildfire Control")]

One of, if not, my favorite deck archetypes that I have drafted in the cube. I love drafting synergistic archetypes and Wildfire sure is one of the classic decks in MTG history and in cube. This deck has been in the cube for a long time and has survived the max-power iteration of the cube and put into this synergy version.

My draft started with a P1P1 Wrath of God and I was fully planning on going into any of the white control strategies (especially since I passed a bunch of RG cards to Brian). When I got a P1P2 Primeval Titan, I then decided I may go into the WG _Landfall_ since that was the newest archetype in the cube and it's really fun (see my practice draft [here](https://www.cubecobra.com/cube/deck/60593a0b099bcd10492e3c3e)). Then I saw a Burning of Xinye for pack 3 and decided to go for it. I didn't get the second copy (Wildfire) until near the end of the draft. I just drafted all the red control elements, creatures that survive Wildfire (as well as planeswalkers) and as many mana rocks as I could get my hands on (just 2, apparently).

This was a really fun draft and well positioned for the other decks in the pod. Game 3 against Jeddy's Orzhov Aggro deck was especially excruciating, since his discard picked all the sweepers from my hand. With 2 turns left, I needed to top deck a sweeper of some sort and my white splash for a single Wrath of God saved me (and for the 3rd point of damage for a Radiant Flames). The decision for Jeddy to go for it or hold resources is a tough decision, but with 6 sweepers in my deck, all my draws were live.

## Jeddy's Deck - [Orzhov Aggro](https://www.cubecobra.com/cube/deck/60602509a0f0791063d31bea)

[![Orzhov Aggro](/images/decks/210327_Jeddy_Orzhov_Aggro.jpg "Orzhov Aggro")]

Jeddy's deck is a pretty nice streamlined aggro deck. Since he was the only black drafter, he got his choice of all the removal spells for his white weenie deck. The combination of white aggressive creatures, backed by a suite of removal and disruption effects is always how I pictured the Orzhov aggro decks playing in cube (Tidehollow Sculler, where you at now?).

Despite Jeddy's missteps in how his cards played out, his deck was actually pretty sweet. Applying pressure early and using black to keep his opponents off-kilter is a great strategy for winning magic games. While straght-forward, Jeddy always manages to get a good draft in.

## Gerf's Deck - [Bant Soulherder](hhttps://www.cubecobra.com/cube/deck/6060220ca0f0791063d30ccd)

<img src="/images/mtg/mh1-214-soulherder.jpg" alt="Soulherder" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/tsr-311-mulldrifter.jpg" alt="Mulldrifter" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/m21-376-jolrael-mwonvuli-recluse.jpg" alt="Jolrael, Mwonvuli Recluse" width="200"/>

[![Bant Soulherder](/images/decks/210327_Gerf_Bant_Soulherder.jpg "Bant Soulherder")]

With 2 copies of Soulherder in his deck, Gerf looks to abuse Enter the Battlefield effects to generatea ton of value. He targets of Man-o'-War, Mulldrifter, Triskelion and Acidic Slime are more than enough umph once he gets his engine going. Another payoff is Ranar the Ever-Watchful every time he blink something, he'll produce a 1/1 Spirit token.

I know with a deck like this it's hard to get the mixure just right and it seemed that Gerf was tinkering with the best version of his deck throughout the day. I'm sure the final version of the deck played much better than in the morning.

## Brian's Deck - [Yorion Aggro](https://www.cubecobra.com/cube/deck/60601f5ea0f0791063d2f907)

<img src="/images/mtg/iko-359-yorion-sky-nomad.jpg" alt="Yorion, Sky Nomad" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/isd-6-champion-of-the-parish.jpg" alt="Champion of the Parish" width="200"/><img src="/images/mtg/c14-50-titania-protector-of-argoth.jpg" alt="Titania, Protector of Argoth" width="200"/>

[![Yorion Aggro](/images/decks/210327_Brian_Yorion_Aggro.jpg "Yorion Aggro")]

This deck was a mess from top to bottom (sorry, Brian). It has no direction as there are aggressive elements to the deck, but then there is Yorion for blink strategies and Titania for land strategies? There are +1/+1 counters, a Sun Titan and Combustible Gearhulk. I don't know what the plan for this deck is, so I will just present it here as is.

----

Overall, this was a great day for cube and not solely because I won with Wildfire. The cube drafted well and played great. There were decks that were drafted that haven't shown up before and I hope that's because people are getting better at drafting this cube.

I don't know if many noticed, but a lot of the cards were updated with the old border cards from Time Spiral Remasterd, which I think absolutely look wonderful; especially the blue and artifact cards. It's a bit sad because the borderless Solemn Simulacrum from Double Masters was replaced with the original art old border one.

With COVID-19 restrictions lifting up soon, I hope we'll be able to get more drafters to play. Strixhaven is releasing in a month and I can't be more excited, it looks like a spells matter set, and the Mystical Archive cards look phenomenal. I always look forward to the next time we cube and after Strixhaven, there will definitely be some spicy cards!
