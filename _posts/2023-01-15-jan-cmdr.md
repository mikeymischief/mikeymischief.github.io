Commander in about a month! We had the same 4 players: Me, Gerf, Brian, and Jubee. We only got to play for about 5 hours on the sunday afternoon before MLK day, but that was good enough for 3 commander games.

<!--more-->

Overall, the wins were pretty evened out amongst everyone with Jubee with [Rivaz of the Claw](https://scryfall.com/card/dmu/215/rivaz-of-the-claw) (again; that's twice in a row), Brian winning with [Lathril, Blade of the Elves](https://scryfall.com/card/khc/1/lathril-blade-of-the-elves), and Gerf winning once with [Atraxa, Praetors' Voice](https://scryfall.com/card/2xm/190/atraxa-praetors-voice). 

Then we played a 3 player game, after Jubee left, where [Prosper, the Tome-Bound](https://scryfall.com/card/afc/324/prosper-tome-bound) won.

# Game 1

<img src="/images/mtg/snc-197-lord-xander-the-collector.jpg" alt="Lord Xander, the Collector" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/c19-45-kadena-slinking-sorcerer.jpg" alt="Kadena, Slinking Sorcerer" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/cmr-587-araumi-of-the-dead-tide.jpg" alt="Araumi of the Dead Tide" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/dmu-215-rivaz-of-the-claw.jpg" alt="Rivaz of the Claw" width="180"/>

I had the win, as Brian milled 75% of my deck with Lord Xander's attack trigger. With nearly my whole deck in my graveyard, I was looking for [Dread Return](https://scryfall.com/card/tsp/104/dread-return), but I didn't see it immediately, so I assumed it was in the final 20 cards of my library. Little did I know, I milled it earlier with the death trigger on my [Stitcher's Supplier](https://scryfall.com/card/j22/73/stitchers-supplier). I could've milled the rest of my library and then casted [Thassa's Oracle](https://scryfall.com/card/thb/308/thassas-oracle).

When that failed (I was milled out), Gerf and Brian both fought each other and basically, gave Jubee the win.

Winner: Rivaz of the Claw

# Game 2

<img src="/images/mtg/khc-1-lathril-blade-of-the-elves.jpg" alt="Lathril, Blade of the Elves" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/neo-123-tatsunari-toad-rider.jpg" alt="Tatsunari, Toad Rider" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/mh2-69-svyelun-of-sea-and-sky.jpg" alt="Svyelun of Sea and Sky" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/puma-U13-tasigur-the-golden-fang.jpg" alt="Tasigur, the Golden Fang" width="180"/>

I got knocked out early (as it always is with Tasigur) when Jubee attacked me at 6 life. 

Winner: Lathril, Blade of the Elves

# Game 3

<img src="/images/mtg/c18-43-lord-windgrace.jpg" alt="Lord Windgrace" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/2xm-190-atraxa-praetors-voice.jpg" alt="Atraxa, Praetors' Voice" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/clb-285-minsc-boo-timeless-heroes.jpg" alt="Minsc & Boo, Timeless Heroes" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/neo-398-hinata-dawn-crowned.jpg" alt="Hinata, Dawn-Crowned" width="180"/>

Atraxa was targeted early because Gerf got a great start with [Broker's Ascendancy](https://scryfall.com/card/snc/170/brokers-ascendancy) and a [Flux Channeler](https://scryfall.com/card/war/52/flux-channeler). With all the _proliferate_ triggers, Gerf had as many as 3 creatures that were about 20 power. After trying to take control of the board with [Willbreaker](https://scryfall.com/card/ori/84/willbreaker) and [Hinata, Dawn-Crowned](https://scryfall.com/card/neo/398/hinata-dawn-crowned), I made a grave error in not blocking both of his 5-power dragons and his [Dragonmaster Outcast](https://scryfall.com/card/afc/124/dragonmaster-outcast), to leave me at 1. The next couple turns, everyone built their board and eventually Lathril overwhelmed everyone (there was an attempt at [Ezuri's Predation](https://scryfall.com/card/clb/824/ezuris-predation), but was countered by Gerf).

Once that was done, Brian (Lord Windgrace) built a huge board and killed Jubee (Minsc & Boo). Gerf just cleaned up Brian after his attacks.

Winner: Atraxa, Praetors' Voice

# Game 4

<img src="/images/mtg/afc-324-prosper-tome-bound.jpg" alt="Prosper, Tome-Bound" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/ncc-2-henzie-toolbox-torre.jpg" alt="Henzie Toolbox Torre" width="180"/><img src="/images/mtg/mh2-214-sythis-harvest-s-hand.jpg" alt="Sythis, Harvest's Hand" width="180"/>

Prosper combo'd out by using a [Jeska's Will](https://scryfall.com/card/clb/799/jeskas-will) to power out a [Gamble](https://scryfall.com/card/sld/188/gamble), then into [Cloudstone Curio](https://scryfall.com/card/rav/257/cloudstone-curio), [Dockside Extortionist](https://scryfall.com/card/c19/24/dockside-extortionist), and [Reckless Fireweaver](https://scryfall.com/card/kld/126/reckless-fireweaver) creating 9 treasures from all the artifacts and enchantments. This allowed me to create infinite mana, so I just casted [Mayhem Devil]() from my hand and cracked all the treasure to ping both of them to death.

Winner: Prosper, the Tome-Bound
