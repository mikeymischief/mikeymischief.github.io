### More Information

I love to play games with emergent gameplay. Anything that allows the player the agency to play how they want.

This blog is a general gaming blog for when I want to write things about games, design, etc. It's main use is for blogging cube draft decks.

I have several cubes on [cube cobra](https://www.cubecobra.com/user/view/5d64bdf2855d7d4dccba2125). Many of these cubes are "set cubes", but my pride and joy is my synergy unpowered cube. Please give it a [look](https://www.cubecobra.com/cube/list/mischief_unpowered)!
